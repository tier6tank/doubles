TODO/IDEAS:
-----------
+ Create a nice (os- and make-utitlity-independent?! if possible) makefile (done, different makefiles)
+ See wxWidget's makefile-collection, this is very nice, for every compiler a special makefile! 
+ putting every compiler's files in a special directory, even different for debug/nodebug unicode/no-unicode build (done)
+ Adding license text as header in source files. done
+ converting all integers to longlong (__i64) integers, where overflow could occur (e.g. the number of double files) done. 
+ unicode support for windows... done!
+ (delete OpenFile, ReadFile, CloseFile and replace them by fopen, fread, fclose) (old)
- adding option -max (max size of files to compare with each other) or -maxbytes (compare max. n bytes of a file)
+ adding IsSameFileFunction (done -> wxWidgets)
+ adding error messages (when finding files, comparing files...) (done via wxWidgets)
+ supporting files over 4 GB always?! yes, i do hope so. 
+ adding option -f <filename> for output to file? (because unicode chars aren't displayed in windows consoles)
  unicode output. done
+ adding option which determines if the small sized files or the large sized files are treated and displayed firstd. done
+ adding option for not going in subdirectories (done)
+ removing clock_t from source, replacing it with time_t: that wasn't an error, it was my fault!
+ (correct cygwin-build lf/cr errors) related to "adding option -f <filename> " seems not to be possible
+ merging searching files and sorting files by size algorithms ? done, now that sortfilesbysize is that fast
+ somehow fixing the problem with the sprintf_s routines, which are currently supported only by microsoft v14 (or deleting
  them?? but they are to nice to delete them, so something other, but what!?!?, has to be done...) done! with v-printf-routines. 
  Nevertheless a call to sscaf_s (if occuring) with an "%s" format argument would very propably leed into trouble, so i must not
  use this!
- playing a bit with some compiling options (especcially optimization for gcc!)
+ replacing the f<*> c functions with the PSDK-functions for true unicode support (difficult, because of stdout?...) done
- add to statistcs sum of bytes read, average speed
+ need a faster container than list for testing for double scanning of directories. done (using set). 
- linux makefile mkdir if
+ removing the current logging construct (removing wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM, because it needs a recompile of wxWidgets), 
  perhaps using wxLogNull and my own error reporting routines? (done via wxLogStream)
+ suppress logging completely (done via wxLogStream)
- delete unneccessary (unix) includes
+ perhaps setting error flag if any error on that file is encountered 
+ add progress display for sorting files by size (not necessary any more)
+ display speed in kbytes/second done (mb/sec)
+ somehow reduce memory consumption done via filedata
+ display option: -o ordered by directory implmented in gui version
- need a close look to signed/unsigned int32/int64 types
- time display under linux does not work properly
+ add option -h for hidden files? done. 
+ instead of recognizing double dirs recognizing double files? (but performance would worsen)??? it is better the way it is 
- status info at the end of the output, not at the beginning, where it cannot be read easily most often
- do a lot of cleanup (e.g. those old BENCHMARK and TEST things)
+ warning message only if there are really unicode characters which cannot be displayed (not only non-ASCII characters) done.
- reacting on signals (do not break program completely, but print the results nevertheless) there is strange behaviour on Strg+c
+ increase speed of comparefiles1 (speed suffers of the steadily seeking of the harddisk) outdated
+ does time(NULL) reduce speed? no.
+ size n/n display at once and at first done.
- option (break on (fatal) errors or not)
+ accelerating search algorithm (partially done by removing double-dir-algorithms). Restored old native algorithms
+ displaying error BEFORE start of program if dir does not exist (done)
+ detecting links in unix important! done.
- make install for unix
+ for every dir its own settings (mask, size, recurse into subdirs, search hidden files...)! done!
- it should be easy to implement a "do not add double files" algorithm (list->set!)
+ fix div by zero errors (not fixed, but disappeared)
- create manifest file
- create configure/automake/autoconf system for unix
+ installer for windows done.
+ removing this *** wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM again (not complete yet)
+ create clear <dirlist> button done.
+ considered ??? files seems to be right
+ heap corruption when canceling in windows! (still there?) outdated.
! checking that there are no double &<> in dialog boxes (sticky todo)
+ fixing those massive memory leaks which occur when interrupted (via bContinue = false) done via File
- supporting unix unicode build
+ ALL memory cleanup with gui (nearly impossible?) perhaps struct to class? outdated
+ instead of yielding creating a new thread? no. Much simpler the way it is. 
+ context menu (delete, create hard-/symlink, open folder) done
+ context menu Ctrl+C (copy) done
+ About box in first dialog? done
- show in progress display which files are compared
+ add remove all button to updateview done. 
+ gui/console version in one package! ok, since now
- storing current user preferences (checkboxes, size, ...)?
- instead of completely removing only move to trash
- synchronization "show messages" checkbox <-> message window
+ open containing folder is not working in linux (perhaps with backslash at the end?) works with leading file:///
+ change modal dialog boxes to not modal dialogboxes done.
+ delete marked instead of the item over which it was and filenames done.
! dynamic cast where possible (Log targets, FindWindow, ...)
+ checkbox with don't confirm delete done.
+ delete key (done)
+ remove list from DeleteFiles
+ Display whether restricted or not(red) "restricted to ...." done.
+ context menu restrict
+ revising all that cleaning up/memory problems associated with fileinfo (class File)
+ reimplement the search for duplicate files algorithm, so that i have no problems with deleting
  a fileinfo object twice! done (File class).
- add a note please no short filesnames?!?
- reimplement a double listed files remove algorithm!
+ instead of CleanUp full return to dialog1 function done.
+ checkbox: store currently displayed / all results! no checkbox, but store always displayed list
- hiding some functions (private to file scope) 
+ creating delete findfileinfo function in dbl.cpp? out of date
+ including the right header (or remove it completely) done.
+ shortening long filename in restriction info? Not important any more, because removed
- what about a program icon?
- foreground/background as in 7-zip 
+ pause as in 7-zip has it now. 
- again: reducing memory consumption (circa 200 MB with circa 803,000 files)
+ batch file for windows me dupf console mode done.
+ rename program (dupfinder -> Duplicate Files Finder) done.
- fixing this bug where whole os (windows) crashes (will be very difficult, because i have no idea
  why it is there - but: it is propably too much memory consumption...)
+ writing .bat file with cd $INSTDIR instruction when installing on 95/98/me. done. 

- installer nice AI
+ wrapping / shortening text which appears when restricting view. Out of date. 
+ hardlinks / softlinks where supported softlinks yes. hardlinks with warning! 
+ display files only in dir ---> and its subdirs???? (even possible?) yes, done.
+ think about minsize, whether it should be perhaps really the MINsize, not the MIN-but-not-EQUAL-size: is minimal size always
+ adding MAXimal size of files option? but what for... done.
+ Add button always enabled (UpdateView changes??) done (also in dialog 3)
- Speed display always, not only for large files
- Treating 0-bytes sized files as double files (option?)
- internationalization
- make dll (with dup.cpp code)?
- on clicking a list item display the information in the controls below?
+ Wrap function!!! does only work with spaced text
- exchange if !__WIN32 by if __UNIX__
- adding unicode support for linux/unix not necessary, but would be nice

+ IsSymLinkSupported should take volume argument or something like this not necessary
+ remove some things in os_cc_specific (e.g. DWORD, LONG, ...) done.
- displaying info (size of all duplicates) in gui version as well
+ make filenames not reappear when View is updated!!!!!!!!! done.
+ delete processed files (deleted/symlinked) from internal list!!!!!!!!! done.
+ do some actions (hard-/softlink) on more than one file? not possible
+ add to result dialog "display files which match mask ..." template added.
* +/- button on headers in result dialog (and dblclick)!!
! supporting watcom compiler (not possible yet because of lack of STL library)
+ replacing list.size() == 0 by list.empty()! done.
? removing some separators of popup menu
--- automake
- correct wxWidgets version number in configure.in
- add precompiled headers to automake
! Autotools
- debug/non-debug version for automake
- move all output files to extra dir 
--- end automake
+ coloring matching files in restricted view
* coloring / ____masking___ out files in one interface
  replace subdirs by general ____mask___ or ___add___ this...
- layout dialog1 / dialog3, and making the Border system (wxLEFT etc. ) a bit more 
  overviewable, perhaps also aligning all elements vertically...
* implement native searching routine also for unix
- remove updateview from dialog3 
? more descriptive name for dialogs?
- instead/additional to match mask "contain string"?
