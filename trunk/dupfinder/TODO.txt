TODO/IDEAS:
-----------
+ Create a nice (os- and make-utitlity-independent?! if possible) makefile (done, different makefiles)
+ See wxWidget's makefile-collection, this is very nice, for every compiler a special makefile! 
+ putting every compiler's files in a special directory, even different for debug/nodebug unicode/no-unicode build (done)
+ Adding license text as header in source files. done
+ converting all integers to longlong (__i64) integers, where overflow could occur (e.g. the number of double files) done. 
+ unicode support for windows... done!
+ (delete OpenFile, ReadFile, CloseFile and replace them by fopen, fread, fclose) (old)
- adding option -max (max size of files to compare with each other) or -maxbytes (compare max. n bytes of a file)
+ adding IsSameFileFunction (done -> wxWidgets)
+ adding error messages (when finding files, comparing files...) (done via wxWidgets)
+ supporting files over 4 GB always?! yes, i do hope so. 
+ adding option -f <filename> for output to file? (because unicode chars aren't displayed in windows consoles)
  unicode output. done
+ adding option which determines if the small sized files or the large sized files are treated and displayed firstd. done
+ adding option for not going in subdirectories (done)
- adding unicode support for linux/unix not necessary, but would be nice
+ removing clock_t from source, replacing it with time_t: that wasn't an error, it was my fault!
+ (correct cygwin-build lf/cr errors) related to "adding option -f <filename> " seems not to be possible
+ merging searching files and sorting files by size algorithms ? done, now that sortfilesbysize is that fast
+ somehow fixing the problem with the sprintf_s routines, which are currently supported only by microsoft v14 (or deleting
  them?? but they are to nice to delete them, so something other, but what!?!?, has to be done...) done! with v-printf-routines. 
  Nevertheless a call to sscaf_s (if occuring) with an "%s" format argument would very propably leed into trouble, so i must not
  use this!
- playing a bit with some compiling options (especcially optimization for gcc!)
- internationalization
+ replacing the f<*> c functions with the PSDK-functions for true unicode support (difficult, because of stdout?...) done
- add to statistcs sum of bytes read, average speed
+ need a faster container than list for testing for double scanning of directories. done (using set). 
- linux makefile mkdir if
+ removing the current logging construct (removing wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM, because it needs a recompile of wxWidgets), 
  perhaps using wxLogNull and my own error reporting routines? (done via wxLogStream)
+ suppress logging completely (done via wxLogStream)
- delete unneccessary (unix) includes
+ perhaps setting error flag if any error on that file is encountered 
+ add progress display for sorting files by size (not necessary any more)
- display speed in kbytes/second
+ somehow reduce memory consumption done via filedata
- display option: -o ordered by directory
- need a close look to signed/unsigned int32/int64 types
- time display under linux does not work properly
+ add option -h for hidden files? done. 
+ instead of recognizing double dirs recognizing double files? (but performance would worsen)??? it is better the way it is 
- status info at the end of the output, not at the beginning, where it cannot be read easily most often
- do a lot of cleanup (e.g. those old BENCHMARK and TEST things)
- warning message only if there are really unicode characters which cannot be displayed (not only non-ASCII characters)
- reacting on signals (do not break program completely, but print the results nevertheless) there is strange behaviour on Strg+c
- increase speed of comparefiles1 (speed suffers of the steadily seeking of the harddisk)
- does time(NULL) reduce speed? 
+ size n/n display at once and at first done.
- option (break on (fatal) errors or not)
- accelerating search algorithm (partially done by removing double-dir-algorithms)
+ displaying error BEFORE start of program if dir does not exist (done)
+ detecting links in unix important! done.
- exchange if !__WIN32 by if __UNIX__
- make install for unix
+ for every dir its own settings (mask, size, recurse into subdirs, search hidden files...)! done!
- it should be easy to implement a "do not add double files" algorithm (list->set!)
+ fix div by zero errors (not fixed, but disappeared)
- adding MAXimal size of files option? but what for...
- think about minsize, whether it should be perhaps really the MINsize, not the MIN-but-not-EQUAL-size
- create manifest file
- create configure/automake/autoconf system for unix
- installer for windows
- removing this *** wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM again
+ create clear <dirlist> button done.
- considered ??? files
- heap corruption when canceling in windows! (still there?)
! checking that there are no double &<> in dialog boxes (sticky todo)
- fixing those massive memory leaks which occur when interrupted (via bContinue = false)
- supporting unix unicode build
- ALL memory cleanup with gui (nearly impossible?)
- instead of yielding creating a new thread?
+ context menu (delete, create hard-/symlink, open folder) done
+ context menu Ctrl+C (copy) done
+ About box in first dialog? done
- show in progress display which files are compared
+ add remove all button to updateview done. 
- gui/console version in one package!
- storing current user preferences (checkboxes, size, ...)?
- instead of completely removing only move to trash
- synchronization "show messages" checkbox <-> message window
